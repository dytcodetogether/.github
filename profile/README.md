# [DAYTON WOMEN CODE TOGETHER](https://www.meetup.com/dayton-women-code-together/)

_formerly GDI Dayton_

Dayton Women Code Together (DWCT) is committed to building an inclusive, judgment-free network of women and non-binary people interested in technology in the Dayton metropolitan region. In addition to the regional interest, we have virtual meetups that are open to a wider audience.

At DWCT, we feel everyone is important and valued and has something to contribute. We are each responsible for doing our part in recognizing the value that each person has to offer. Therefore, we do not tolerate any form of harassment or prejudice. Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dytcodetogether/resources/blob/main/assets/DWCT_EVENT-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.pdf) to learn more.
